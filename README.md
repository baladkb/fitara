## Management and Oversight of Federal Information Technology Public Comments 

The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act ([FITARA)](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ291/PLAW-113publ291.pdf#page=148]), passed by Congress in December 2014, is a historic law that represents the first major overhaul of Federal information Technology (IT) in almost 20 years.  Since FITARAâ€™s passing, OMB published guidance to agencies to ensure that this law is applied consistently governmentwide in a way that is both workable and effective. This guidance is now available as OMB Memorandum M-15-14: Management and Oversight of Federal Information Technology.

OMB used this Github site to collect public feedback on proposed guidance in April 2015.
